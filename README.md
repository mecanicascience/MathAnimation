## Description
A Java code that allow Math Animation inspired by 'manim' Python library.<br />
You can draw functions, points and animate them based on time.<br />
Then, you can export your graph animation on a mp4 file simply by pressing a few buttons.<br />

## Functionnalities
This code is non-profit and under developpement. Once launched, press 's' to start recording and 'q' to stop.<br />
MathAnimation was developped using the Processing language and the ffmpeg library.<br />
Please be free to post suggestions about improvement or implementations.
